I see the bad moon rising  
I see trouble's on the way  
I see earthquakes and lightnin'  
I see bad times today

Ah, don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricane's a-blowin'  
I know the end is comin' soon  
I feel a river's overflowin'  
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Ah, don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
Alright

Hope you got your things together  
Hope you are quite prepared to die  
Looks like we're in for nasty weather 
One eye is taken for an eye

Well, ah, don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise

Ah, don't go 'round tonight  
It's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise
